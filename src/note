useState()
The useState hook lets you add state to functional components
In classes, the state is always an object
With the useState hook, the state doesn't have to be an object
The useState hook returns an array with 2 elements
The first element is the current value of the state, and the second element is a state setter function(component will re-render)
New state value depends on the previous state value? pass an function to the setter function


useEffect()
import useEffect from react, call it within the component, pass a function which has to be executed after every render of that component
it runs after every render
